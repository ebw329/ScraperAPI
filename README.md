# # ScraperAPI Promo Code 2026: Save 10% on Your First Month, Unlimited Bandwidth, Easy Integration

Look, we've all been there. You're trying to scrape some data from a website, and suddenly you're blocked. Then you try rotating proxies manually, but half of them don't work. Then comes the CAPTCHA hell. Before you know it, you've spent three days trying to get data that should've taken three hours.

That's where ScraperAPI comes in. It's not some magical solution that'll solve all your problems while you sleep—but it does handle the annoying parts of web scraping so you can focus on actually using the data instead of fighting with infrastructure.

## What Actually Is ScraperAPI?

ScraperAPI is a web scraping API that sits between your application and the websites you want to scrape. Think of it as a middleman who knows all the tricks. Instead of sending requests directly to a website and getting blocked, you send them through ScraperAPI, and they figure out how to get past the defenses.

The service handles proxy rotation, CAPTCHA solving, JavaScript rendering, and geotargeting automatically. You make a simple API call, and they return the data you need. No need to maintain your own proxy pools or figure out how to bypass PerimeterX or DataDome.

Founded in 2018, ScraperAPI has grown into one of the go-to solutions for businesses that need reliable web scraping at scale. They serve everyone from small startups to large enterprises, with customers ranging from ecommerce companies to hedge funds.

## Current Promotions and Promo Codes for 2026

Here's the good news—ScraperAPI offers several ways to save money in 2026. The most consistent discount is the **START10** promo code, which gets you **10% off your first month** on any plan. It's not a massive discount, but it's something, and it works across all their paid plans.

For annual subscriptions, you're looking at roughly 10% savings compared to monthly billing. So the Hobby plan drops from $49/month to around $44/month when billed annually. The Startup plan goes from $149/month to approximately $134/month annually. It's basic math, but it adds up over time.

Some third-party coupon sites claim to have deals offering 25% to 50% off, but here's the reality—most of those are either expired, affiliate-specific, or require special circumstances. The reliable discount you can count on is the START10 code for 10% off your first month.

## ScraperAPI Pricing: What You Actually Get

ScraperAPI uses a credit-based system, which can be confusing at first. Each API request costs a certain number of credits depending on what features you use. A basic request costs 1 credit, but if you enable JavaScript rendering, that jumps to 5 credits. Premium proxies? That's 10 credits. Geotargeting to specific countries adds extra costs too.

Here's the breakdown of their current plans:

| Plan | Monthly Price | API Credits | Concurrent Threads | Geotargeting | Best For |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1,000 credits | 5 threads | US & EU only | Testing and small projects |
| **Hobby** | $49 | 100,000 credits | 20 threads | US & EU | Small businesses and side projects |
| **Startup** | $149 | 1,000,000 credits | 50 threads | 50+ countries | Growing businesses with regular scraping needs |
| **Business** | $299 | 3,000,000 credits | 100+ threads | 50+ countries | Companies scraping at scale |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | 5,000,000+ credits | 200+ threads | All features | Large organizations with custom requirements |

The Free plan is genuinely useful for testing. You get 1,000 credits per month with 5 concurrent connections, which is enough to prototype and see if the service works for your use case. No credit card required.

The Hobby plan at $49/month is where most individual developers and small businesses start. 100,000 credits sounds like a lot, but if you're using JavaScript rendering (5 credits per request), that's really only 20,000 requests. Still decent for many use cases though.

The Startup plan is the sweet spot for businesses that are serious about web scraping. One million credits with 50 concurrent threads means you can run multiple scraping jobs simultaneously and handle geotargeting to over 50 countries.

One thing to know: all plans include unlimited bandwidth, which is actually a big deal. Some competitors charge by bandwidth, which can get expensive fast when you're downloading large amounts of data.

## Key Features That Make ScraperAPI Worth Considering

**Automatic Proxy Rotation**: ScraperAPI maintains a pool of millions of proxies and automatically rotates them for you. No need to buy, maintain, or rotate proxies yourself. They handle the infrastructure.

**CAPTCHA Handling**: This is probably the feature people appreciate most. ScraperAPI automatically detects and solves CAPTCHAs using machine learning. You don't see them, you don't deal with them—they just handle it in the background.

**JavaScript Rendering**: Many modern websites load content dynamically with JavaScript. ScraperAPI can render these pages using real Chrome browsers, so you get the fully loaded page content instead of an empty HTML shell.

**Geotargeting**: Need to see what a website looks like from France, or Australia, or Brazil? ScraperAPI lets you target specific countries (and even cities on higher plans) to see localized content and pricing.

**Smart Retry Logic**: If a request fails, ScraperAPI automatically retries it using different proxies and configurations. You only pay for successful requests, which is fair.

**Structured Data Endpoints**: For popular sites like Amazon, Google, and others, ScraperAPI offers specialized endpoints that return clean, structured JSON data instead of raw HTML. This saves you from writing parsing code.

## Real-World Use Cases

**Ecommerce Price Monitoring**: Companies use ScraperAPI to track competitor pricing across hundreds of online stores. Instead of manually checking prices or building complex scrapers, they make API calls and get structured pricing data back. One ScraperAPI customer mentioned they monitor 50,000+ products daily across multiple marketplaces.

**SEO and SERP Analysis**: Digital marketing agencies scrape search engine results to track keyword rankings, analyze competitor strategies, and monitor SERP features. ScraperAPI's dedicated SERP endpoints make this straightforward—just provide your query, get back structured results.

**Real Estate Data Collection**: Real estate investors and agencies scrape property listings from sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, and others to identify investment opportunities. These sites typically have strong anti-bot measures, but ScraperAPI handles the complexity of bypassing them.

**Market Research**: Businesses collect product reviews, social media mentions, and consumer sentiment data to understand market trends. This requires scraping data from multiple sources at scale, which is exactly what ScraperAPI enables.

**AI Training Data**: With the rise of AI and machine learning, companies need massive amounts of training data. ScraperAPI helps collect and structure web data that feeds into machine learning models.

## What Users Actually Say

Let me give you the real feedback, not the marketing spin. Based on reviews from Capterra, G2, and Trustpilot, here's what users appreciate and what frustrates them:

**The Good**: Users consistently praise the ease of integration. You can literally get started in minutes with a few lines of code. The documentation is clear, the API is straightforward, and the customer support is responsive. One reviewer mentioned getting help within 30 minutes of reaching out.

The success rate is solid—most users report 90%+ success rates on difficult websites. The automatic handling of proxies and CAPTCHAs just works, which is what you want from a service like this.

**The Not-So-Good**: The credit system confuses people initially. It's not always clear how many credits a particular request will consume until you make it, especially when features like JavaScript rendering are auto-enabled based on the website.

Some users experienced slower response times compared to competitors, particularly on JavaScript rendering requests. This makes sense—rendering a full Chrome browser takes time—but it's worth knowing if speed is critical for your use case.

The pricing can get expensive quickly if you're not careful with credit usage. Users who enabled premium features without fully understanding the credit costs sometimes burned through their monthly allocation faster than expected.

## How ScraperAPI Compares to Competitors

**vs. Bright Data**: Bright Data (formerly Luminati) is more expensive but offers more advanced features and a larger proxy network. ScraperAPI is simpler and more affordable, making it better for small to medium businesses. Bright Data is overkill unless you need enterprise-grade features.

**vs. ScrapingBee**: ScrapingBee is similar in pricing and features. The main difference is that ScrapingBee focuses more on JavaScript rendering with real Chrome browsers, while ScraperAPI has broader proxy coverage and better CAPTCHA handling. It's honestly a toss-up between these two.

**vs. Apify**: Apify is a full web scraping platform with a marketplace of pre-built scrapers. It's more complex and has a steeper learning curve. ScraperAPI is just an API—simpler and faster to integrate, but less flexible for custom scraping workflows.

## Getting Started: The Actual Process

Starting with ScraperAPI is genuinely simple. You sign up for a free account, get your API key, and start making requests. Here's what a basic request looks like:

python
import requests

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
url = 'http://httpbin.org/ip'

response = requests.get(
    url='https://api.scraperapi.com/',
    params={
        'api_key': api_key,
        'url': url
    }
)

print(response.text)


That's it. You're scraping through their proxy network with automatic rotation. To enable JavaScript rendering, just add `render=true` to the parameters.

For structured data from popular sites, they offer dedicated endpoints:

python
# Get Amazon product data
response = requests.get(
    url='https://api.scraperapi.com/structured/amazon/product',
    params={
        'api_key': api_key,
        'asin': 'B073JYC4XM'
    }
)

print(response.json())


You get back clean JSON with price, title, reviews, ratings—everything already parsed and structured.

## Should You Actually Use ScraperAPI?

Here's the honest take: ScraperAPI makes sense if you need to scrape data reliably without spending weeks building infrastructure. It's not the cheapest option, but it's competitively priced for what you get.

It's particularly good for businesses that need to scrape difficult websites (ecommerce sites, social media, sites with strong anti-bot measures) or need to scrape from multiple geographic locations.

It's probably overkill if you're just scraping a few simple websites with no anti-bot measures. For basic scraping, you can use free tools or build something simple yourself.

The free plan is generous enough that you should just try it. Sign up, make some test requests against the sites you want to scrape, and see if it works for your use case. No risk involved.

## Tips for Maximizing Value

**Start with the Free Plan**: Seriously, test everything first. Make sure ScraperAPI can successfully scrape your target websites before committing to a paid plan.

**Understand Credit Usage**: Check the documentation to understand exactly how many credits different features consume. JavaScript rendering and premium proxies eat through credits quickly—only use them when necessary.

**Use Structured Data Endpoints**: If you're scraping Amazon, Google, or other supported sites, use the structured endpoints instead of parsing HTML yourself. They're more expensive (5-25 credits) but save you tons of development time.

**Monitor Your Usage**: Keep an eye on your credit consumption through the dashboard. It's easy to burn through your monthly allocation if you're not paying attention.

**Consider Annual Billing**: If you know you'll be using ScraperAPI long-term, annual billing saves you about 10% compared to monthly payments.

## The Bottom Line

ScraperAPI isn't perfect, but it's solid. It handles the annoying parts of web scraping—proxies, CAPTCHAs, JavaScript rendering—so you can focus on using the data instead of fighting with infrastructure.

The pricing is reasonable for what you get, especially considering you pay only for successful requests and get unlimited bandwidth. The **START10** promo code gives you 10% off your first month, which is a decent starting discount.

If you're serious about web scraping and tired of dealing with blocked requests and infrastructure headaches, give ScraperAPI a shot. The free plan is genuinely useful for testing, and upgrading is straightforward once you know it works for your use case.
